          <li>
            This plan will be about the same as the plan for part 1
          </li>
          <li class="bold">This project plan must be a formal document</li>
          <ul>
            <li>By this, I mean that I will not accept one sentence, saying something like "I'm going to make the site better."</li>
            <li>The document should include the following:</li>
            <li>Contact Info (name, email, etc.)</li>
            <li>A brief summary of Part 1 that includes screnshots of the first iteration to illustrate the point</li>
            <li>A detailed description of what you plan on doing for part 2</li>
            <li class="bold">IF YOUR PART 2 PROJECT PLAN IS NOT SUBMITTED, OR DOES NOT ADHERE TO THE ABOVE REQUIREMENTS I WILL NOT ACCEPT YOUR PROJECT PART 2 UNTIL IT DOES</li>
          </ul>
          <li>Your plan should include the following:</li>
          <ul>
            <li>What new technologies will you be implementing</li>
            <li>What new content (if any) will you be adding</li>
            <li>Switching framework? Moving to MVC? Doing all on your own?</li>
            <li>Feel free to ask any questions you may have, or if you want to use this as a forum to run your idea by me</li>

        <p class="uc red-txt bold">Requirements</p>
        <ul>
          <li class="bold">First and foremost, the changes must be significant and/or meaningful. Meaning that changing a few lines of code, or changing some variables will not be enough to count as a qualified submission</li>
          <li>JS or jQuery must be used in some way for the second part of the project</li>
          <ul>
            <li>If you do not know how to, or cannot think of a way to do this ask the TA or myself for advice</li>
            <li>This is still going to be a php project, so taking everything out of php and putting it in html files will not be acceptable</li>
            <li>You can incorporate an API, create form submissions without reloading the page, etc.</li>
          </ul>
          <li>If you, for some reason, did not have some kind of database finctionality n part 1, you must include that in part 2</li>
          <ul>
            <li>If you did not make db functionality for part 1, you must demonstrate the functionality to me on the day it is due</li>
          </ul>
          <li>The required amount of pages has not changed, however if you want to include more pages, that is fine with me, but don'g go overboard</li>
          <li>If you were lacking in actual content for part 1, take this opporunity to put meaningful site content into the project</li>
          <li>Since we've gone over more CSS and HTML and things like that, you may want to refresh your site viaually. Make things look a little better, make the layout easier on the eyes, etc.</li>
          <li>It shouldn't take you as long to do part 2, unless your first iteration was lacking</li>

        <p class="uc red-txt bold">Submission Guidelines</p>
        <ul>
          <li>For the second part of the project, all submissions MUST be through git</li>
          <li>Create a repo for your project and send me the link to it when it is complete</li>
          <li>ZIP FILES VIA EMAIL WILL NOT BE ACCEPTED, IF YOU NEED HELP GETTING THINGS IN GITHUB PLEASE CONTACT ME</li>
          <ul>
            <li>Additionaly:</li>
            <li>Make a copy of your files from part 1</li>
            <li>Create a directory, OUTSIDE of the directory for the final submission called "Legacy"</li>
            <li>In here you will place the files from Part 1 and include a text file with the following information:</li>
            <li>What did you change/enhance from part 1?</li>
            <li>If there was a third part to the class project, what would you like to implement?</li>
            <li>What did you learn between part 1 and part 2?</li>
            <li>What did you like about this project? How could it have been better?</li>
            <li class="bold">Please put some thought into answering these questions. I do not want to see one line answers that read something like "I learned some stuff." or "I changed some code." or anything like that.</li>
            <li class="bold">If you do not include the old files or the text file, your project will not be considered to be complete and you will not receive a grade.</li>

        <p class="uc red-txt bold">Project Plan</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Basically, this will act as a roadmap for both you and me, so we can have a clear outline of what our projects will entail. Nobody wants to program themseleves into a corner and wind up having to scrap hours of work if they can help it. You can be as verbose as you like in this, but I would like to see at least a couple sentences on each point.
          </li>
          <li>
            Your plan should include the following:
          </li>
          <li>
            What technology are you going to be using? (PHP for the most part, but it never hurts to outline everything you are going to use.)
          </li>
          <li>
            What is your site going to be about? Self promotion? Promotion of something else? Etc. The worst that can happen is that I will suggest another route.
          </li>
          <li>
            Using a frontend framework? Which one?
          </li>
          <li>
            Also, anything else you think may be important to have added to the plan. We just want to cover all our bases.
          </li>
          <li>
            A list of ANY questions you may have about your idea or the project in general. This is the best time to hammer out any of the smaller details.
          </li>
          <li>
            OPTIONAL: Do you want to use some advanced topics? Such as MVC structure, or using PHP as a backend for some other frontend framework, etc. This will not entitle you to different or better grading. You will still be accountable for all the same requirements. I am well enough equipped to review, grade and comment on most implementations.
          </li>
          <li>
            Email me this information is whatever format you like. If you would like further direction on anything, let me know. Let's have fun and demonstrate what we've learned so far!
          </li>
          <li>
            NOTE: Since the class project is split up into two milestones (part one due halfway through, part two due at the end), this is really only in relation to the first part of this project. All the requirements will be the same for part two, but just implementing features based on what we will learn during the second half of the class.

      <div class="col-lg-12 centered">
        <p class="uc red-txt bold">Requirements</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            One page or multi page layout. Minimum of three sections/pages
          </li>
          <li>
            Page Examples:
          </li>
          <li>
            About, contact, resume/CV, fan page about your favorite rapper or super hero, anything is fine. Just remember though, you may want to keep it professional in the event you want to use this as your actual personal site down the road.
          </li>
          <li>
            You may use a frontend framework, such as Bootstrap or Foundation. You may also use a template, all I ask is that you do not use it as it comes. Add your own layer of style on top of what is included.
          </li>
          <li>
            All pages (views and includes, etc) should be written in PHP, at least for this first part of the project
          </li>
          <li>
            One component/page of your site should be a contact form, I would prefer this to submit to a database, but if you want to defer the database and have it email you or write to a text file, that is ok too.
          </li>
          <li>
            Programming Requirements:
          </li>
          <li>
            Intelligent use of topics covered in class so far. Such as:
          </li>
          <li>
            Use of variables, includes, arrays, functions, file reading etc.
          </li>
          <li>
            When should I use [requirement]?
          </li>
          <li>
            Ex. If you have a collection of links that have text and hrefs that need to be displayed, store them in an array and correctly loop through them where you want them to display
          </li>
          <li>
            Ex. Repeating some PHP more than once in a PHP block? Store it in a variable.
          </li>
          <li>
            Ex. Don't want to write your header and footer on each page for a multi page approach? Use an include file. Similarly, if you have a function that you will use over and over, that should also go into an include file.
          </li>
          <li>
            There are no hard requirements for what PHP to use and when. The best approach would be to use as many of the topics covered in class (appropriately) as necessary to make the site work and prove your ability
          </li>
          <li>
            If you are unsure on what to use or when/how to use it, please reach out to me or a TA
          </li>
          <li>
            PLEASE DO NOT HESITATE TO ASK IF YOU NEED CLARIFICATION OR HELP WITH ANYTHING. I CANNOT STRESS THIS ENOUGH

        <p class="uc red-txt bold">Submission Guidelines</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            TWO methods of submission will be accepted.
          </li>
          <li>
            FIRST OPTION: place everything in a GitHub repo that I can access to pull down the code. If you are not familiar with this method and would still like to submit this way, please contact me so I can help you out.
          </li>
          <li>
            SECOND OPTION: zip file of all necessary files. I do not want to see the contents of the zip file to produce just a pile of files in an unorganized manner. All assets should be intelligently located in folders.
          </li>
          <li>
            Basically there should be one parent folder that contains everything. Then one folder for each asset group. Ex. CSS, Images, Views etc. Feel free to do some research on the topic.
          </li>

          <li>
            I'm going to be more attentive to the way you write your code for this project. In the event that it will become public facing in the future, it is important for you to have well written, clean semantic code. Myself or the TAs will be available to help you with this as well.
