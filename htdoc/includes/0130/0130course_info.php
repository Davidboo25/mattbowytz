          We will be using PHP, MySQL, JavaScript, HTML (with DOM), CSS, XML (with DOM) and possibly other systems as well. Software may be available in University or Departmental labs, or it may required as downloads from the Web. We will also explore other topics, such as code management and other relevant technologies as time permits.

            Unless otherwise stated, Each student is expected to do his/her own work. For a first offense, a student caught collaborating / cheating in any way will receive a zero for the exam / homework / project in question. In the event of a second offense, the student will receive an F for the course and may be subject to stronger action. Note: Submissions that are alike in a substantive way (not due to coincidence) will be considered to be cheating by ALL involved parties. Please protect yourselves by only storing your files in private directories, and by retrieving all printouts promptly. For more information on the Academic Integrity Policies of the School of Arts and Sciences, see this <a href="http://www.as.pitt.edu/faculty/policy/integrity.html">link</a>  
          </li>
          <li>
            Students are encouraged to attend all lectures, which frequently include material that is not directly taken from the text. If a student misses a lecture, he/she is still responsible for the material covered and is advised to copy the notes from a classmate.
          </li>
          <li>
            An abundance of information, including announcements, handouts, review sheets and solutions will be posted on my web page (and possibly TA pages as well) throughout the term. Students are expected to aware of all information that is posted on our web pages, and should access them frequently.
          </li>

            Students with Disabilities: If you have a disability for which you are or may be requesting an accommodation, you are encouraged to contact both your instructor and Disability Resources and Services, 216 William Pitt Union, 412-648-7890 or 412-383-7355 (TTY) as early as possible in the term.

          <li>The dates for exams will be posted to the Important Dates section, found below.</li>
          <li>
            Students are expected to be present for both exams. Make-up exams will only be given in the event of an emergency, and only if I am informed in advance. If you cannot contact me directly, send me email or call the CS Department (624-8492) and leave me a message. Failure to notify me prior to missing an exam will result in a zero for the exam.

        <ul>
          <li>
            In addition to the tests and quizzes, we will create a personal website which will utilize everyhting we have learned thus far.
          </li>
          <li>
            This will be split out into 2 sections. The first section will incorporate concepts we have gone over up until about the halfway point of class. You'll never guess what the second sections is about...
          </li>
          <li>
            You are free to leverage front end frameworks for visual appearance and some functionality. Bootstrap and Foundation are two of the most popular and actively supported platforms.
          </li>
          <li>
            I will be paying attention to the quality of code you write. This can include such things as consistent spacing, php writing style, etc. It doesn't matter which style you adopt, just stick to it! Comment on code when necessary, and keep the code clean and human readable.
          </li>
          <li>
            This will be a "flat" site. This means that we will not implement any server side frameworks or MVC structures.
          </li>
          <li>
            Specific details will arrive soon!

          <li>
            <span class="bold">NOTE:</span> Please do not copy and paste source code from the example files that are found on this site. All code written for in-class exercises should be written by you. Example files should only be used as a reference.
          </li>
          <li>
            As often as possible, we will have in-class exercises. You can also think of these as a type of homework assignment as well, as they won't officially be due until one week wfter they are assigned.
          </li>
          <li>
            In class exercises must be demonstrated using each student's own Web server (XAMPP), either installed and run on a personal machine or installed on a flash drive and run in a classroom machine.
          </li>

            The actual number of exercises may vary throughout the term.

            Quizzes will be given during recitations or in class (time permitting), and will be announced at least one class or recitation before they are given. They will generally include material covered in the previous class(es) and recitation(s).
          </li>
          <li>
            Two quizzes will be given, each counting for 5% of the final grade.

          <li>
            As with exams, quizzes can only be made up if you contact myself or the recitation instructor in advance. If you miss a quiz without informing myself or the recitation instructor, you will receive a zero for that quiz.
