		<h1>BONUS ASSIGNMENT 1</h1>
		<h2>THIS IS A PRETTY WEBSITE</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>Requirements:</li>
			<ul>
				<li>Using javascript and/or jQuery, you will make a call to an api to retrieve search terms for a "type ahead" search.</li>
				<li>This will be similar to the way google works when you type in a search term.</li>
				<li>When the user begins to type something, it should filter out the data list and present the relevant results.</li>
				<li>
					Upon display of the results, the user should be able to click on them and it will take you to google search results for that term.
				</li>
				<li>The url is "http://www.mattbowytz.com/simple_api.(json|html|xml)"</li>
				<li>There are a few different query params you can/need to use, making the request should tell you what they are.</li>
				<li>There are some easter eggs in the responses as well!</li>
				<li>Style for the results should match the existing form as closely as possible.</li>
				<li>Get the starter files <a href="/deliverables/bonus1.zip">here</a>.</li>
			</ul>
			<li>We will be starting this in class, so I can assist you personally if you need it.</li>
			<li>Some of you are new to js and jQuery and some of you are not. That being said, here are some more rules:</li>
			<ul>
				<li>I prefer you to not use any more libraries aside form jQuery itself.</li>
				<li>All scripting should be done in the external js file included with the starter files.</li>
				<li>Other than this, you may do whatever you want to get it to work.</li>
			</ul>
			<li>Grading:</li>
			<ul>
				<li>Remember, this is worth up to 50% of the points missed on the midterm.</li>
				<li>The app must function according to specs.</li>
				<li>You must style the app and include all described functionality.</li>
				<li>Partial credit will be giving, where appropriate, if all requirements are not me.</li>
			</ul>
			<li>Above all, have fun with this one and let me know if you have any questions!</li>
		</ul>
